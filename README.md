# Word-Search-Kata
This is a program to search for words in a word search puzzle. It is written in Java, using the Eclipse IDE and Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

When run, the program displays the wordlist and puzzle. A word list array is created, and each search method is called for each word. If found, the word is displayed on the console, followed by the coordinates of each letter in the found word. There are eight search methods, to search in all possible directions.

Since this is an exercise, only the letters of the search words are displayed in the puzzle. All other letters were assigned an 'X' to make it easier for the viewer to identify the search words.
